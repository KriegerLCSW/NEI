                        <li><strong>Real Name:</strong> George Krieger </li>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>You know the story... Everyone knows the story. Peter Parker was a sickly teenager, orphaned and living with his aunt and uncle. A bright kid, he was hopeless socially, and bullied mercilessly. That is, until he was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the proportional strength, stamina, agility, and near-precognitive "Spider-Sense" of a common house spider. That story, however, is not <em>this</em> story...</p>
                <p>George Krieger was not sickly, nor a teenager, nor orphaned. He grew up in a tumultuous, emotionally abusive home, and struggled to find his way, but he did do just that. He attended college, earning a Bachelor's degree in psychology, followed by Master's degrees in social work and education. He raised a daughter out of wedlock, and then married when he was 41, having a son and another daughter. After working as a social worker and psychotherapist in nearly every arena, he finally settled down as a school social worker in an elementary school, just a few miles outside the Chicago city limits. </em>That</em> is where our story <em>begins</em>.
                <p>Peter Parker was bitten by a <em>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</em>, or <b>common house spider</b>, and gained proportionate strength, stamina, speed, agility, and a precognitive "Spider Sense".
                <p>Acting as a chaperone when the first-graders at his school went on a field trip to Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, George was bitten by a radioactive spider, but of a different genus and species. Bitten by a <em>Phidippus audax</em>, or <b>bold jumping spider</b>, that had stowed away on the `U-505 Submarine, George gained a similar power-set to Peter and other Spider-Men and -Women, including enhanced (in comparison to other Spiders) strength, as well as enhanced vision and "Spider-Sense".

                <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>

                <p>Dauntless shares the same basic power set as Spider-Man from Earth-616. As such, he possesses:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Strength:</strong> Dauntless can lift and press approximately 10 tons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Stamina:</strong> Dauntless' musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to impair him.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Durability:</strong> Dauntless' body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Agility:</strong> Dauntless' agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Equilibrium:</strong> He has the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Reflexes:</strong> Dauntless' reaction time is similarly enhanced and is about 15 times that of an ordinary human.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wall-Crawling:</strong> Dauntless can cling to walls and ceilings and crawl across them like a spider.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regenerative Healing Factor:</strong> If injured, Dauntless is able to recover from mild to moderate injuries at an accelerated rate. He can regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precognition ("Spider-Sense"): </strong> Dauntless possesses an extrasensory "danger" or "spider" sense which warns him of potential immediate danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the back of his skull, and links with his superhuman kin of similar power and origin.</li>
                </ul>
