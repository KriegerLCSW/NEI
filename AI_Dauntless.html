                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>You know the story... Everyone knows the story. Peter Parker was a sickly teenager, orphaned and living with his aunt and uncle. A bright kid, he was hopeless socially, and bullied mercilessly. That is, until he was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the proportional strength, stamina, agility, and near-precognitive "Spider-Sense" of a common house spider. That was all it took for him to become a masked crimefighter. So what does George have to do with it?</p>
                <p>George, originally a healthy teen from suburban New Jersey, had just graduated from high school when the news hit about the mysterious Spider-Man. Unlike many of his peers, George didn't idolize the wall-crawler, nor did he yearn for the power to make the bullies pay. George was different, a maverick in every sense of the word. Tall, athletic, and charismatic, George was a magnet for the fairer sex. But, he also had an uncanny ability to come out on top. Bullies didn't target George because George wouldn't take their guff. The few who tried were humiliated and sent packing.</p>
                <p>He didn't play sports because George wasn't a team player. He didn't go to college because George had no interest in attending. Yet, George was never at a loss for a party to attend, or a girl to attend with. He drove the best cars, dressed in the finest clothes, and lived in the biggest house. Nothing could slow George down. That is, until the bite...</p>
                <p>The radioactive spider that gave Peter Parker his powers, that bite gave George powers beyond anything Parker ever dreamed of. The spider wasn't just radioactive, it was a mutant. The rare arachnid was a member of a new breed, one that was affected by pollution in the air. The spider's bite gave George more than a killer immune system. It gave him super strength, and the ability to control his size at will. In addition, George's already formidable looks were enhanced to superhuman levels. If Parker was the "Amazing" Spider-Man, George was the "Spectacular" George.</p>
                <p>Now possessing the power to increase his size to well over twice his normal height, George faced a dilemma. The spider was stolen from the laboratory by a super-villain who sought to harvest its organs for profit. George couldn't allow that to happen. He had the power to do something about it, and the choice was obvious...</p>
                <p>Dauntless was born...</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Game Stats</h2>
                <p>Dauntless's ability to alter his size made him a formidable opponent. He could increase his size to gain superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerhouse in battles. His control over his size also allowed him to shrink, making him a versatile and elusive target. Below are the game stats for Dauntless in the DC Heroes Role-Playing Game:</p>
