            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>You know the story... Everyone knows the story. Peter Parker was a sickly teenager, orphaned and living with his aunt and uncle. A bright kid, he was hopeless socially, and bullied mercilessly. That is, until he was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the proportional strength, stamina, agility, and near-precognitive "Spider-Sense" of a common house spider. That story, however, is not <em>this</em> story...</p>
            <p>George Krieger was not sickly, nor a teenager, nor orphaned. He grew up in a tumultuous, emotionally abusive home, and struggled to find his way, but he did do just that. He attended college, earning a Bachelor's degree in psychology, followed by Master's degrees in social work and education. He raised a daughter out of wedlock, and then married when he was 41, having a son and another daughter. After working as a social worker and psychotherapist in nearly every arena, he finally settled down as a school social worker in an elementary school, just a few miles outside the Chicago city limits. </em>That</em> is where our story <em>begins</em>.
            <p>Peter Parker was bitten by a <em>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</em>, a fairly innocuous species of house spider. It causes the most painful bite of any North American spider, but the venom is weaker than that of even the western black widow. George Krieger was bitten by the <em>Loxosceles reclusa</em>, the brown recluse. It has a cytotoxic venom that can cause necrotic skin lesions and mild flu-like symptoms. Krieger didn't even notice when he was bitten in his sleep. He wasn't aware of the bite until several days later, when he was showering after a workout at the gym, and saw a necrotic sore the size of a quarter on his thigh. The next day, when the nausea and cramps set in, and he was vomiting, he knew he had to see a doctor.</p>
            <p>That is when the dreams began...</p>
