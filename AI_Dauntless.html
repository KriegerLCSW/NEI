                <section class="character-history">
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>George Krieger lived a quiet life on Earth-616. He was an accomplished scientist, specializing
                        in advanced robotics. His life took a drastic turn when a mysterious accident occurred in
                        his lab, exposing him to a unique form of radiation. Instead of succumbing to the radiation's
                        effects, George discovered he had gained incredible strength and durability.</p>

                    <p>Embracing his newfound abilities, George took on the superhero identity of Dauntless. He dedicated
                        himself to protecting the innocent and combating various threats, from street-level crime to
                        cosmic adversaries. Dauntless quickly gained recognition as a formidable and honorable hero.</p>

                <section class="character-powers">
                    <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Dauntless possesses superhuman strength, allowing him to lift and carry heavy loads. His
                        durability is enhanced, making him resistant to physical harm. Additionally, George has
                        heightened agility and reflexes, enabling him to react swiftly in combat situations.</p>

                    <p>One of Dauntless's unique abilities is his control over energy fields. He can generate powerful
                        energy blasts, create protective force fields, and manipulate energy for various effects. This
                        versatility makes him a formidable force in battles against both superpowered and technological
                        foes.</p>

                    <p>Dauntless is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, combining his strength and agility with
                        combat training to effectively take down adversaries. His strategic mind and scientific
                        background further contribute to his success as a superhero.</p>
