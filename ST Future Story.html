							<h1>Future's So Bright...</h1>

							<h2>Chapter One &#149; Stardate 41139.4</h2>

							<h3>Do you know where you're going to?</h3>

							

<p>It was quiet when he woke up.  Not silent; he could hear quiet conversation, although he was unable to comprehend any meaning behind the soft voices.  He opened his eyes and found himself in a semi-circular room of muted greens and tans.  Against each facet of the semi-circle was a reclining bed sized for one person.  Against the wall opposite the beds, through an open doorway, sat a woman at a desk.  She appeared to be in her late 30's, with long red hair and green eyes.  The left side of her jacket bore a red name-plate which he could not quite make out as it was partially obscured by the woman's long, red hair.  Below the name-plate was a badge resembling a stylized capital letter "A", over which was a golden insignia.  He couldn't quite make that out either. Underneath the gold insignia were three silver circles.  Was that some kind of rank insignia? She was speaking to dark-haired woman who was standing and facing her.  As he tried harder to focus, his vision blurred and his eyes teared up.  He closed his eyes and said, "Excuse me, ma'am?"  At least, he started to say that.  His voice cracked after the first syllable, and he cleared his throat, trying again, while ignoring the fact that his voice sounded oddly highly-pitched when it cracked.
</p>
<p>
The dark-haired woman turned as he spoke, and he could see that she, too, was wearing a badge with the same golden symbol.  Now that she was facing him, he could now recognize that golden symbol as a caduceus.  Over her badge, the dark-haired woman also had a name badge.  It read:

 <p style="color:red;">OGAWA</p>

<p>  Below the badge were two silver circles.
</p>
<p>
The red-haired woman stood and nodded to the dark-haired woman.  "Thank you, lieutenant." 
</p>

<p>
"Ohhh," he thought, "they actually *are* rank insignia pips, like the sleeve insignia used by the U.S. Navy.  That would make the other woman a full commander... Or maybe because of the caduceus &#x2624;, she's a doctor?  Probably the *ranking* doctor..."
</p>

<p>The red-haired woman walked toward him, and as she drew closer, he could now see that the golden symbol was, indeed, a caduceus, just as it was on Lieutenant Ogawa's badge.  He could also see the name-badge of the red-haired woman clearly: 

 <p style="color:red;">CRUSHER</p>

<p>"Huh," he thought, "Odd name for a doctor."</p>

<p>He smiled, "Dr. Crusher, my apologies, or do you prefer Commander Crusher?"</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher stopped, looking startled, "What... What did you say?"</p>

<p>He cleared his throat again, "I'm sorry doctor... commander... I'm sorry, I was't sure how to properly address you, so I took a guess.  I must have guessed wrong..."  He trailed off, uncertainly.</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher shook her head, "No, 'Doctor Crusher' is what most people call me, but I was surprised to hear you speaking, by which I mean, speaking actual *words*. When I  first heard you, I just thought you were crying..."</p>

<p>He blinked. "Crying?" he thought.  "Why would I be crying?"  Not knowing what else to do, he apologized again, "I'm sorry, Dr. Crusher.  I was just trying to get your attention to ask where I was.  My voice cracked, and, well, let me try again.  My name is George Krieger.  Could you please tell me where I am?"  I mean, I am guessing I this is a naval installation, but the last thing I remember was driving outside of Chicago, so I am not sure how the Navy got involved...</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher watched him for a moment as he finished speaking.  For his part, George kept silent.  Years as a social worker had enabled him to tolerate uncomfortable silences.  He knew that, eventually, Dr. Crusher would feel the social obligation to reciprocate in the conversation.  Slowly, Dr. Crusher began to nod, and, as he anticipated, she replied, "You are not on a facility of the United States Navy, because there the Uniter States Navy no longer exists as an entity.  Nor does the United States, for that matter, because..."  Dr. Crusher paused, taking a deep breath.</p>

<p>Before she could continue, George blurted out, "Because we're in the future? We're in the future!</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher nodded, "Our present, your future.  You mentioned that you remember driving outside of Chicago.  Do you recall the date?"</p>

<p>George chuckled, "Of course, the date was today, February 21, 2025.  My 55th birthday."</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher made a note on her PADD and looked up, "Happy Birthday, um, *Mister* Krieger.  The interesting coincidence is that today is February 21, but the year is 2364.  The reason for my initial surprise is that you don't exactly look like an average 55-year-old human male."  She gestured with her hand to her left, and said, "Computer, mirror."</p>

<p>George turned his neck to the right, slowly, all the while wondering why his neck was moving so slowly.  He saw the reflection of Dr. Crusher, and, across from her, the bio-bed containing not an adult human male, but a *baby*.  George blinked a few times and slowly turned his neck back to Dr. Crusher.</p>

<p>George cleared his throat again, uncomfortably aware of the fact that his voice was not getting any less high-pitched and weedy, "I din't suppose you know how this happened?  Or how to reverse the processs?  Not to mention how to get us back to the 21st century?  Wait... Us... Where is Kataryna, my daughter? Is she here... I mean, now?  She was with me in the car..."</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher tapped her PADD and the curtain between George's bio-bed and the one to his right shimmered into nothingness.  Sleeping in the bed with a young human female with blond hair. "Is this Kataryna?  Does she look to be the age she's supposed to be?"</p>

George nodded, sighing, "She's almost seven.  Is she ok?"</p>

<p>Dr. Crusher smiles, "She is perfectly fine.  Once I saw you, I thought, perhaps, she was similarly affected, but it seems that you are the only lucky one.  You are perfectly healthy, you are simply young, much younger than you were before.  As to why, well, off the top of my head, I would surmise that whatever temporal anomaly transported you and your daughter to this time period also reversed the aging process in your body.  As to how, and if it is reversible... Well, about that, I have no idea."</p>
